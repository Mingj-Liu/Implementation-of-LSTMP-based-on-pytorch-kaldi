# Implementation-of-LSTMP-based-on-pytorch-kaldi

This is the implementation of Deep Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network with projection layer(DLSTMP).

This is the supplementary part of neural_networks.py in pytorch-kaldi.

To run, you can just add this class into neural_networks.py and run the cfg file following the guideline of pytorch-kaldi.
