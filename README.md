# Implementation-of-LSTMP-based-on-pytorch-kaldi

Implementation of Deep Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network with projection layer(DLSTMP).

This is the supplementary part of neural_networks.py in pytorch-kaldi.

You can just add this class into neural_networks.py, add the cfg file to path: cfg/TIMIT_baselines.

Use command: python run_exp.py cfg/TIMIT_baselines/TIMIT_LSTMP_mfcc.cfg to run.
